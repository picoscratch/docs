# FAQ

## Which ports do I need to open in my firewall?

For the PicoScratch MINT device to work properly, you need to open the TCP port 2737 on your firewall. This port is used for communication between the device and the PicoScratch MINT server.

In addition, you need to open TCP port 443 (HTTPS) to allow updates and communication with the PicoScratch MINT server.

If you are a teacher and your PicoScratch MINT device can't connect to our server, please contact your school's IT department to open the required ports.
